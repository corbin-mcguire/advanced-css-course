How CSS works behind the scenes
    Load HTML --> Parse HTML --------> DOM
                       |
                       |
                Load CSS --> Resolve conflicting CSS declarations (cascade) --> CSS Object Model
                             Process Final CSS Values
                                                                                        |
                                                                                        |
                                                                                        |
                                                                                        |
                Final Rendered Website             <---                  Website Rendering:  <-- Render Tree
                                                                    the visual formatting 
                                                                    model
